## üöÄ Method 1: Local Network Testing (Recommended)

### Step 1: Start Mobile Development Server
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/macbookpro/Desktop/mAnIfestAtIon

# Start mobile-optimized server (serves on all network interfaces)
npm run dev:mobile

# Alternative: Manual command
npm run dev -- -p 3333 -H 0.0.0.0
```

### Step 2: Find Your Computer's IP Address

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Get your local IP address
npm run test:mobile
# or manually:
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter.

### Step 3: Access on Your Phone

1. **Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network**
2. **Open mobile browser** (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android)
3. **Navigate to:** `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3333`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3333`
